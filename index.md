### Jazz the Skeleton



Jazz is a Gaster Blaster-ed Papyrus from Undertale!

He is meant to be a helper ghost, reminding you to take care of yourself. 
He has all sorts of advice to offer, as well as options to cheer you up or suggest some helpful links. 
He will also remind you to stand up or drink some water!

Aside from that, you can build up a relationship with him, either positive or negative. 
Depending on the path you take, he will treat you differently, and new options will be unlocked.
To progress either way, you need to pile on enough positive or negative actions.

To unlock certain secrets, you might want to check his chest. It might even lead to learning his story. 
However, this path might not be open from the start...


I strongly suggest you use the z_undertale balloon by Zarla-S for him!
