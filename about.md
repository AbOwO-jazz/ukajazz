Jazz the Skeleton, an UT based Ukagaka, is ready to settle on your desktop.

Ukagaka (伺か), Nanika (何か), Sakura (さくら), Nin'i-tan (任意たん) or Nise-Haruna (偽春菜) is a catch-all term for Japanese software  which shares a single format and function: to provide mascot  characters for the user’s computer desktop. These characters can  perform some useful functions such as checking e-mail or adjusting the  clock of the computer, but are most popular as an aesthetic add-on which “says” weird things. 

Jazz is meant to be a helper ghost, reminding you to take care of yourself.  He has all sorts of advice, as well as options to cheer you up or suggest some helpful links.  He will also remind you to stand up or drink some water! 

Aside from that, he has:
Abilities to change your wallpaper, check your clock, take out your trash and more!
(Possible) secrets!
Three relationship options: friend, beloved... or a friendly acquaintance!
Different advice to give!
An option to apologise for your misdeeds!
-slaps the skeleton- And all the love that he can hold!!!

To use him, you should:

1. Download the program that runs his software, SSP. Run the program. You will see the base ghost, Emily the catgirl. She speaks Japanese only, but do not be afraid.

2. Download Jazz’s nar. file.

3. Download the z_undertale balloon by @zarla-s​, the one that he will be using.

4. Drag both the nar. and the balloon onto Emily, and wait till the end of the download. Right-click her, go to the “Change Ghost” tab and pick Jazz!

5. Congratulations!!!

A little about interacting with Jazz:

Right-click Jazz to bring up the SSP right-click menu. 
Double-click Jazz on his legs or arms to bring up his own personal menu.
You can pet Jazz by stroking his head, chest or face, and hit him by double-clicking them. He will have unique reactions to all.
The surest way to avoid beating him up on accident when summoning his menu is to double-click on his shorts or legs. 
However, from v.1.2 there is a 'failsafe' message that should prevent you from accidentally beating him up.

He is meant to be a helper ghost, reminding you to take care of yourself. 
He has all sorts of advice to offer, as well as options to cheer you up or suggest some helpful links. 
He will also remind you to stand up or drink some water!

Aside from that, you can build up a relationship with him, either positive or negative. 
Depending on the path you take, he will treat you differently, and new options will be unlocked.
To progress either way, you need to pile on enough positive (pets, praise, gifts) or negative (beating, scolding) actions.

To unlock certain secrets, you might want to 1) check his chest, 2)check a certain photograph in his inventory. 
It might even lead to learning his story. 
However, this path is only open to his friends/lovers!

The baloon used with Jazz is z_undertale by Zarla-S! (Technically, you can use the default one as well, but it won't give you that natural feel,
haha.)
