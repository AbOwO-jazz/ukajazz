Hello! 
My name is Ab, and the ghost you have just downloaded is named Jazz.

---------------------

Right-click Jazz to bring up the SSP right-click menu. 
Double-click Jazz on his legs or arms to bring up his own personal menu.
You can pet Jazz by stroking his head, chest or face, and hit him by double-clicking them. He will have unique reactions to all.
The surest way to avoid beating him up on accident when summoning his menu is to double-click on his shorts or legs. 

He is meant to be a helper ghost, reminding you to take care of yourself. 
He has all sorts of advice to offer, as well as options to cheer you up or suggest some helpful links. 
He will also remind you to stand up or drink some water!

Aside from that, you can build up a relationship with him, either positive or negative. 
Depending on the path you take, he will treat you differently, and new options will be unlocked.
To progress either way, you need to pile on enough positive or negative actions.

To unlock certain secrets, you might want to check his chest. It might even lead to learning his story. 
However, this path might not be open from the start...

The baloon used with Jazz is z_undertale by Zarla-S! (Technically, you can use the default one as well, but it won't give you that natural feel,
haha.)

Jazz has been created with the help of a template/tutorial by Zarla-S and I cannot be more grateful for those.
