Upd.1.2:

Fixed the bug with the items you give him. Hopefully, that would prevent the lines from showing at the wrong time.

***

Upd.1.3:

Several bugs edited out.

Added the option to check inventory and yourself in CHECK menu.

Added the option to see the link to Version Information in Config menu.

Added Easter eggs in naming and birthday setting sections.

Added the Milestones feature. Now you will know when you level up either in goodness or badness! Though if you are petting or beating him nonstop, you might miss the message.

There was a nasty bug going with the number of gifts you give Jazz, sending the number into hundreds. It is edited out now, but I cannot do much about it post factum, aside from making sure it does not happen again and giving it a funny CHECK. Sorry for that. ;v;

Added the chance to see a Mysterious Photo in Jazz's inventory (if you are friends/lovers). It adds up to your chances of learning his story.

Added the CHECK for your relationship status set in the "CHECK yourself" menu.
